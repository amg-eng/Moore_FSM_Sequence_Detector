# Moore_FSM_Sequence_Detector
detect Moore FSM Sequence in the input signal.
The output of the Moore FSM only goes high when a "1011" sequence is discovered by the Moore FSM, which continuously monitors a binary sequence from a digital input. The following illustration depicts the state diagram of the Moore FSM for the sequence detector.
